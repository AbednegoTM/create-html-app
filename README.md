# create-html-app

---

When am teaching basic HTML|CSS|JS in class everytime we start a new topic I always have to create a new project, the process gets tedious sometimes. So as i am learning the nodeJS core modules I thought of creating a tool that I can customize and use to generate projects for me in class. **it's very new with lots todo and bugs.**.

Hown to run it :
`$ node main.js < project name >`
e.g `node main.js git-basics`
